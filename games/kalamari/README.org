* To build
#+begin_src shell
emacs --script kalamari.el
#+end_src

This will generate a Game Boy Advance ROM file ~kalamari.gba~ in the current directory.
I've only tested this with my Emacs - there are a couple of dependencies, namely ~dash~, ~f~, ~s~, and ~ht~.
You likely already have these, and if you don't you can install them using your method of choice.
* To run
You'll need a Game Boy Advance emulator to run the ROM.
I've only tested with [[https://mgba.io/][mGBA]], so I'd recommend using that one.
It probably runs on other emulators, and probably also on real hardware too!
(But I haven't had time to test this just yet.)

#+begin_src shell
mgba-qt kalamari.gba
#+end_src
